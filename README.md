# Path Consistency Learning in Keras

This repository is a slight modification of the [repository](https://github.com/rarilurelo/pcl_keras). It contains the implementation of Path Consistency Learning Algorithm. The main article can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08892.pdf). PCL is a very efficient algorithm to handle off-policy data. 


## Requirement
* Keras 1.2.2
* Python 3.5.2
* gym 0.8.0

## Usage
```
python run_pcl.py
```
